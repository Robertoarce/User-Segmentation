1) mark user who had enough time (first game must be before X day (30 days before end of data))  --> create field  'has_30_days_seniority' 
1) make visualizations, UMAP, TSNE, PCA
1) train supervised model for segmentation
1) SHOW visual results
1) use segmantation for spenders vs no spenders
futher studies:
1) use segmantation for high spenders vs low medium spenders



Implementation:

1) How does a 'better' matchmaking affect? 
- it helps the study of users by segmenting
- it helps as a guide for the matchmaking algorithm

2) Testing

- for testing:
1) Make sure the data is equivalent to the training, meaning (no data drift)
1) The model is relevant ( model test scores)
